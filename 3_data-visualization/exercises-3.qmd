## Attach packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## `penguins` tasks

```{r}
data(penguins)
names(penguins)
summary(penguins)
```

Create a histogram (`geom_histogram()`) of `bill_depth_mm`.

```{r}

```

Plot a scatter (`geom_point()`) of `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm`.

```{r}

```

Plot a box plot (`geom_boxplot()`) comparing male vs. female body masses for Gentoo penguins. (Hint: you will need to `filter()` `penguins` first, since we are only interested in Gentoo for this question.)

```{r}

```
